## Trend-Centric Recommendation System
Employ AI-driven recommendation systems that analyze current fashion trends, customer preferences,
and purchase history to deliver tailored product suggestions, enhancing customer engagement and conversion rates in the fast fashion segment.

## Solution 
AI Assistant Recommendation System by WebScrapping 
Developing an AI Assistant which generates Trend-Centric Recommendations by using a Recommendation model developed by taking data 
from Myntra's website by Webscrapping using Selenium and generating solutions by checking the ratings,prices and needs of the user 
at the current time 

## Steps
1. Web scrapping using Selenium by using Beautiful Soup. We can also scrape data by first trying to parse with lxml if it's not present try looking for something in the script tag, sometimes data is loaded as JSON in script if it's not there either try something else like Selenium/Playwright.
2. Building a Trend-Centric Recommendation System
3. AI Assistant to deal with the queries regarding fashion industry and current fashion trends.

## Setup of local environment

1. Fork this repo
2. Run the command git clone https://github.com/VanadiumV/parsers.git
3. All the data used for training and testing the models (webscrapping and recommendation system).
4. Run the jupyter notebook WebscrappingusingSelenium.ipynb
5. Navigate to app.py repo.
6. Run command python Apis.py
7. Navigate to static folder.
8. First install all dependencies by running npm i.
9. Run command npm start.
10. The frontend will start to run on localhost:3000.
11. Check out the predictions.
12. Setup for recommendation analysis model
13. Run the jupyter notebook recomendation_rating_clothes.ipynb


## Future Plans
1. Further improving the bot by providing the real-time data of Myntra, so as to further help user to get access of latest trends on Myntra along with the trends in the world.
   - This will not only help users but also helps sellers to further customize their products according to user to increase the sell.
2. Further improving the accuracy of the recommendation system by dividing the into multiple parts:
   - Based on temporary trends influenced by festivals, influenced by actors, movies, etc.
   - Based on users purchase history.
   - Trending on Myntra.
   - New on Myntra.
